# Progress-Report-Manager - DownloadPrint

This component comprises two sub-components:
* A Python script to download the Google Docs as PDFs.  
* A BASH script to send the PDFs to the printer.

## Download

Activated versions of GAM _MUST NOT_ be stored in GIT for security reasons.
The .gitignore file is set to ignore the ./gam/ directory.
